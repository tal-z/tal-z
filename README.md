### Hi, I'm Tal! 
### ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). Previously, I worked for the NYC Dept. of Sanitation, where I developed composting programs, managed data for an emergency food delivery program, and reported NYC's annual recycling statistics. 

###### What I'm up to
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on [WikiFilms](https://github.com/tal-z/WikiFilms), [tMinusMBTA](https://tminusmbta.herokuapp.com/), and [ColorController](https://github.com/tal-z/ColorController).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning full stack web development using Python and Javascript, with a bit of data science, NLP, and GIS mixed in to keep it fun.
