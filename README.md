### Hi, I'm Tal! 

I am a Software Engineer at [Pearl Health](https://pearlhealth.com/). Prior to joining Pearl, I worked for the NYC Department of Sanitation, where I developed citywide composting programs, managed data for an emergency food delivery program, and oversaw reporting of NYC's annual recycling statistics. 
Also, I recently attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

###### What I'm up to
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on [TextCam](https://github.com/tal-z/TextCam), [Beantown Compost](https://github.com/tal-z/BeantownCompost), and [ColorController](https://github.com/tal-z/ColorController).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about full stack web development using Python and Javascript, with a bit of data science, NLP, and GIS mixed in to keep it fun.
