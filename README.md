### Hi, I'm Tal! 

I am a Software Engineer at [Pearl Health](https://pearlhealth.com/). Prior to joining Pearl, I worked for the NYC Department of Sanitation, where I developed citywide composting programs, managed data for an emergency food delivery program, and oversaw reporting of NYC's annual recycling statistics. 
I also attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) last year. It was awesome.

###### What I'm up to
- 📖 I'm reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Klepperman](https://dataintensive.net/).
- 🐈 I'm building a browser extension called _[Catnip!](https://github.com/tal-z/catnip)_, which improves your web browsing experience by showing you more cats. 
- 💬 I’m slowly building an emoji-centric chat application and game, presently called [GuessMoji](https://github.com/tal-z/GuessMoji), using websockets.
