### Hi, I'm Tal! 
### ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). Previously, I worked for the NYC Dept. of Sanitation, developing composting programs, managing data for an emergency food delivery program, and reporting NYC's annual recycling statistics. 

###### What I'm up to
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on: [WikiFilms](https://github.com/tal-z/WikiFilms), [tMinusMBTA](https://tminusmbta.herokuapp.com/), and [ColorController](https://github.com/tal-z/ColorController).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning: full stack web development using Python and Javascript, with a bit of data science, NLP, and GIS mixed in to keep it fun.
