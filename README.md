### Hi, I'm Tal! 

I am a Software Engineer at [Pearl Health](https://pearlhealth.com/). Prior to joining Pearl, I worked for the NYC Department of Sanitation, where I developed citywide composting programs, managed data for an emergency food delivery program, and oversaw reporting of NYC's annual recycling statistics. 
I also attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) a little while back. It was awesome.

###### What I'm up to
- 📖 I'm reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://dataintensive.net/).
- 💰 I'm writing a Discord bot, called [BetBot](https://github.com/tal-z/BetBot) for keeping track of casual wagers between friends.
- 🕶 I'm building a Chrome browser extension called [Shades](https://github.com/tal-z/OverlayExtension), which allows you to configure and apply semi-transparent colored overlays on different browser tabs, that persist while you navigate the web.

###### What I finished recently
- 🐈 I built a browser extension called _[Catnip!](https://github.com/tal-z/catnip)_, which improves your web browsing experience by showing you more cats.
   💬 I built [Telephonish](https://github.com/tal-z/telephonish), AKA the classic game of Telephone translated over the web into stories, drawings, poems, and more. Built using React, Django for [the backend](https://github.com/tal-z/telephonish_be), and websockets.
- 💬 I built an emoji-centric chat application and game called [GuessMoji](https://github.com/tal-z/GuessMoji), also using websockets.
